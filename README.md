// The Snake Game - in Java Script using p5.js framework

/*Object of Game:  Move snake around screen with direction arrows (up, down, left, right)
                   and try to eat the fruit.  Each time you eat a piece of fruit 
				   the snake will get longer.  The speed of the game will also increase

My modifications to game (dspiers 8/9/2018):
 1)  Don't allow snake to move backwards
 2)  Increase speed of game (frameRate) as snake gets longer
 3)  If snake goes off the screen, reappear on opposite side
